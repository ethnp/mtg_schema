# purpose
The purpose of this repo is to maintain a consistent schema for a mtg api I am developing.
The schema is largely inspired by magicthegathering.io's schema, as I am using their apis to build my app.
However, I am still building this as my own schema so that in the unlikely event that they go away, I can keep a consistent schema and simply change my etls and stuff to point to another api.
